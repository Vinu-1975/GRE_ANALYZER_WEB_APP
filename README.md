# 🎓 GRE Score Analyzer

During my **3rd SEMESTER**, our team of four 🚀 embarked on a journey to develop the **GRE Score Analyzer** website as part of our DBMS course project.

## 📌 Overview

The **GRE Score Analyzer** offers a unique capability to estimate a user's GRE score 📈 based on the data they input. Our algorithm uses historical trends and cut-offs to make this estimation. Moreover, based on this predicted score, the platform can even suggest potential Ivy League universities 🏛️ for aspiring students.

## 🖼️ Website Previews

Our platform boasts separate portals for both users and administrators, streamlining the user experience and ensuring efficient management. Moreover, one of the standout features is the capability to glean insights about how many individuals qualified for GRE from various cities.

Here's a sneak peek into our project:
