# 🎓 GRE Score Analyzer

During my **3rd SEMESTER**, our team of four 🚀 embarked on a journey to develop the **GRE Score Analyzer** website as part of our DBMS course project.

## 📌 Overview

The **GRE Score Analyzer** offers a unique capability to estimate a user's GRE score 📈 based on the data they input. Our algorithm uses historical trends and cut-offs to make this estimation. Moreover, based on this predicted score, the platform can even suggest potential Ivy League universities 🏛️ for aspiring students.
